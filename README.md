React props exercise 

Task:
Change the Avatar component to request the closest image size based on the size prop. Specifically, if the size is less than 90, pass 's' (“small”) rather than 'b' (“big”) to the getImageUrl function. Verify that your changes work by rendering avatars with different values of the size prop and opening images in a new tab.
